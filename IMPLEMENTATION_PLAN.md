# PRISM Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of PRISM using **Beads for project management**, inspired by Steve Yegge's Beads architecture and designed to integrate with your AI Design Agent workflow. We'll use Beads to track all development tasks, creating a dogfooding experience where we use Beads to build a tool that complements the Beads workflow.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Primary**: Generate visual PNG mockups from Phase 1 JSON structures
- **Secondary**: Enable efficient approval workflow for Phase 1 → Phase 2 transitions  
- **Tertiary**: Integrate seamlessly with development workflows (Git, CI/CD, VS Code, **Beads**)

## 📋 Beads Integration Strategy

We'll use Beads to manage this entire project, creating issues for each major milestone and task. This gives us:

- **Dependency tracking**: Clear understanding of what blocks what
- **Progress visibility**: Always know what's ready to work on
- **Quality gates**: Each issue has clear acceptance criteria
- **Decision logging**: Document why we made specific choices

## 📋 Beads-Managed Implementation

### Current Project Status

```bash
# Check what's ready to work on
bd ready

# See full project dependency tree
bd dep tree PRISM-1

# Start working on the foundation
bd update PRISM-5 --status in_progress
```

### Issue Breakdown

We've created a structured issue hierarchy in Beads:

**Epic Level**:
- `PRISM-1`: Core PRISM Implementation (Main epic)
  - `PRISM-2`: Phase 1: Foundation - CLI and Basic Rendering
  - `PRISM-3`: Phase 2: CLI Polish and Advanced Features  
  - `PRISM-4`: Phase 3: Workflow Integration

**Foundation Tasks** (Ready to start):
- `PRISM-5`: Setup Go project structure with Cobra CLI
- `PRISM-6`: Implement JSON parsing for Phase 1 structures (blocked by #5)
- `PRISM-7`: Create basic rendering engine with PNG output (blocked by #6)
- `PRISM-8`: Implement Phase 1 constraint validation (blocked by #6)

### Development Workflow with Beads

```bash
# Daily workflow
bd ready                           # See what's available
bd show PRISM-5          # Get task details
bd update PRISM-5 --status in_progress
# ... do the work ...
bd close PRISM-5 --reason "Go project setup complete with Cobra"
bd ready                           # See what's unblocked
```

### Next Issues to Create

As we work through the foundation, we'll create additional issues:

**Week 1 Issues**:
- Layout calculation engine
- Component rendering system
- Test framework setup
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

**Week 2 Issues**:
- Multi-viewport support
- Annotation system  
- Error handling and validation
- Performance optimization

**Week 3+ Issues**:
- Batch operations
- Comparison features
- Configuration system
- Documentation

```

### Key Interfaces

```go
// Renderer interface for different output formats
type Renderer interface {
    Render(structure *types.Structure, opts RenderOptions) (*RenderResult, error)
    SupportedFormats() []string
}

// Validator for Phase 1 constraints
type Validator interface {
    Validate(structure *types.Structure) (*ValidationResult, error)
    CheckPhase1Constraints(structure *types.Structure) error
}

// Layout engine for component positioning
type LayoutEngine interface {
    CalculateLayout(components []Component, container Bounds) ([]LayoutNode, error)
    SupportedLayouts() []string
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Day 1-ongoing)
- **JSON parsing**: All valid/invalid structure combinations
- **Validation**: Phase 1 constraint checking
- **Layout engine**: Component positioning algorithms
- **Rendering**: Individual component rendering
- **CLI**: Command parsing and flag handling

### Integration Tests (Week 2)
- **End-to-end**: JSON file → PNG output validation
- **Command-line**: Full CLI workflow testing
- **Error handling**: Invalid inputs and edge cases
- **Performance**: Memory usage and rendering speed

### Golden Tests (Week 3)
- **Visual regression**: Compare rendered output against reference images
- **Cross-platform**: Ensure consistent output across OS
- **Viewport**: Mobile/tablet/desktop rendering accuracy

- **RC** (End of Week 4): Production-ready with docs
- **v1.0** (Week 5): First stable release

### Distribution
```bash
# Go install
go install github.com/yourusername/prism@latest

# GitHub releases
curl -L https://github.com/yourusername/prism/releases/latest/download/prism-linux-amd64

# Package managers (future)
brew install prism         # macOS
choco install prism        # Windows
```

## 🚀 Getting Started with Beads

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Start the first task**:
   ```bash
   bd update PRISM-5 --status in_progress
   ```

2. **Create the Go project structure** (following the task requirements):
   ```bash
   go mod init github.com/yourusername/prism
   ```

3. **Work through the dependency chain**:
   - Complete `PRISM-5` → unlocks `PRISM-6` and `PRISM-8`
   - Complete `PRISM-6` → unlocks `PRISM-7`
   - Each completion creates momentum for the next tasks

### Beads Workflow Benefits

**For this project, we get**:
- **Clear priorities**: Always know what to work on next
- **Dependency tracking**: No working on blocked tasks
- **Progress visibility**: See how each task contributes to the whole
- **Quality gates**: Each task has defined acceptance criteria
- **Decision history**: Document why we chose specific approaches

**Example daily workflow**:
```bash
# Morning: See what's ready
bd ready

# Start working on highest priority ready task  
bd update PRISM-5 --status in_progress

# Document decisions as you work
bd update PRISM-5 --notes "Chose github.com/gg-go/gg for image rendering - better performance than standard library"

# Complete the task
bd close PRISM-5 --reason "Go project structure complete, all tests passing"

# See what's now unblocked
bd ready
```

### Integration with Design Process

This creates a perfect feedback loop with your AI Design Agent process:

1. **Design Agent creates Phase 1 structures** → saved as JSON
2. **PRISM renders them** → creates PNG mockups  
3. **User reviews and approves** → ready for Phase 2
4. **Beads tracks all development** → maintains quality and progress

The tool we're building will eventually render the Beads project structure itself - a perfect dogfooding scenario!

## 🔄 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Layout algorithm complexity** | High | Start simple, iterate with real examples |
| **Cross-platform rendering differences** | Medium | Early multi-platform testing |
| **Performance with large layouts** | Medium | Benchmarking and optimization from Day 1 |
| **Memory usage spikes** | Low | Streaming and cleanup patterns |

### Timeline Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Feature creep** | High | Strict MVP scope, defer non-essential features |
| **Testing time underestimate** | Medium | Parallel test development with features |
| **Polish taking longer** | Medium | Time-box polish work, ship MVP first |

## 📝 Documentation Plan

### User Documentation
- [ ] **README**: Quick start and installation
- [ ] **CLI Reference**: Complete command documentation
- [ ] **Examples**: Real project samples
- [ ] **Integration Guide**: Git hooks, CI/CD usage

### Developer Documentation
- [ ] **Architecture**: Code organization and patterns
- [ ] **Contributing**: Development setup and guidelines
- [ ] **API Reference**: Internal package documentation
- [ ] **Performance**: Benchmarks and optimization notes

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Today)**: 
   - Set up Go project structure
   - Initialize git repository
   - Create basic Cobra CLI skeleton

2. **Week 1 Focus**:
   - Get basic JSON parsing working
   - Implement simple rectangle rendering
   - Establish testing patterns

3. **Key Decision Points**:
   - Image library choice (Day 2)
   - Layout algorithm approach (Day 6)
   - Error handling patterns (Day 10)

This plan balances ambition with practicality, following Beads' example of building high-quality, focused tools that integrate well with developer workflows. The phased approach ensures we have a working prototype quickly while maintaining code quality throughout.

Ready to start implementation? I recommend beginning with the project setup and basic CLI structure to establish the foundation.
